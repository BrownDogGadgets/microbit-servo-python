"""
Library to use position servos directly connected to a signal pin on a micro:bit

This version works with pin13, pin14, and pin15 for the Brown Dog Gadgets Bit Board Rover.



Notes: 

    * Power should be supplied from a different source than the micro:bit directly
        as most servos work best with at least 4.5V.

    * The servo should be connected to the micro:bit's ground as well

    * I feel pretty good about the position servo code, but the rotation servo code
        might need some tweaks.
